# copy-w3.css-jeans-Template

This website was built for educational purposes only.
The design was taken from <a href="https://www.w3schools.com/w3css/w3css_templates.asp">W3.CSS Website Templates</a> tutorial. 

Link to the original Demo:

Link to the version I made:

Results:
1. Despite looking simple, this design required relatively more lines of code that other w3.css templetes did. 
   Because of this, the whole code might seem a little messy, as I haven't got yet how to optimise it.
2. Anyway, this is the first time I made an eCommerce website, and I can't let the world (read: two uninterested followers) not to know about it.
3. Actually.. there are some mistakes there which I hope to set one day.
